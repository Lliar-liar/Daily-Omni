        ],
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "This revision improves difficulty by 1) Using precise terminology ('sustained gunfire bursts' instead of generic 'gunshots'), 2) Enhancing distractors' plausibility through semantic specificity ('numerical countdown sequence' instead of basic 'countdown', 'foreign-language command phrases' instead of generic speech), and 3) Maintaining unambiguous correctness through strict alignment with the audio-visual synchronization data where only gunfire corresponds to the specified visual event.",

            "D. Hip-hop music with whoosh sounds"
        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The revision improves specificity by focusing on concurrent audio-visual relationships rather than temporal sequence. Choice B is correct because electronic music (0-10s) co-occurs with shooting visuals, and gunshots directly align with firearm use in the range. The original question's sequence framing was misleading as gunshots span both segments but only overlap with music in 0-10s. New distractors use plausible audio events from other training scenarios (countdown in self-defense, whoosh in driving) while maintaining one clear correct answer.",

        "Question": "During the police training exercises, what contextual clue confirms that the pepper spray incident was intentional?",
        "Choice": [

        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The revision improves difficulty by requiring correlation between specific audio cues and training contexts. While the original choices focused on general possibilities, the new options reference actual concurrent events from different training segments (audio captions' countdown during self-defense practice vs visual pepper spray incident). Only choice B correctly ties the countdown (20-30s audio) to structured training scenarios, whereas A links to shooting practice, C to driving drills, and D to sparring context - all authentic elements from the video but unrelated to the pepper spray sequence.",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "This revision improves difficulty by: (1) Making all choices vehicle-test related rather than mixing unrelated options (like original 'leisure driving'), (2) Using technical terms like 'simulating emergency response' instead of generic 'advanced training', (3) Adding specific course elements ('water-filled with orange cones') requiring visual context recall. The correct answer requires understanding that the complex obstacle course with safety markers and police training context (from other scenes) indicates emergency response simulation rather than basic water resistance tests or performance trials.",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The revision improves upon the original by: 1) Using more precise terminology ('impact techniques' and 'wound care' instead of vague 'strikes/bandaging'); 2) Introducing plausible distractors based on other training elements (B references equipment seen in other segments, C uses the countdown audio cue, D leverages organizational aspects); 3) Eliminating the original's problematic observer distinction (D in original) that created multiple valid answers. The new version requires deeper analysis of activity purposes rather than surface-level observations.",

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "This revision improves accuracy by aligning with the audio-visual pair (countdown with self-defense practice). The original answer was incorrect as indoor combat sparring was paired with foreign language speech. New choices focus on distinct activities from the same segment, eliminating the geographically ambiguous 'indoor combat facility' and adding medically plausible 'bandaging' as a distractor while maintaining only one valid answer.",

        ],
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The revision adds specificity to the human speech ('excited' from the audio caption) and creates more temporally precise distractors. B incorrectly merges 0-10s gunshots with unrelated music, C references speech from 20-30s training, and D combines elements exclusive to 20-30s. This forces examinees to precisely map concurrent audio-visual pairs rather than relying on general associations.",

        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "The original question had an incorrect answer (A) as pepper spray training wasn't the first event. By leveraging audio-visual synchronization (countdown from 3-1 occurs during self-defense practice), the revised question tests precise multimodal understanding. This increases difficulty by requiring temporal alignment of sound cues with visual events, while maintaining all original plausible choices with B being the correct synchronized event.",
