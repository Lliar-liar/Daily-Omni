        "Question": "Which audio statement accompanies the first appearance of the 'Heavy Equipment Operator Training Centre' sign?",
        "Choice": [
            "A. 'emailed Anderson for about a year'",
            "B. 'we get out'",
            "C. 'we're in West Bank, BC... I'm part of this course'",
            "D. 'last time, go through all that'"
        ],
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explaination": "The visual caption explicitly states the program sign appears simultaneously with Sara's introductory speech about the course location and participation (0-10s). Other audio clips occur during indoor binder scenes or later equipment shots.",

        "Question": "What is the correct order of visual events after Sara's initial outdoor introduction?",
        "Choice": [
            "A. Binder close-up → Construction site → Indoor desk scene",
            "B. Indoor desk scene → Binder close-up → Machinery action",
            "C. Construction site → Indoor desk scene → Binder close-up",
            "D. Machinery action → Indoor desk scene → Binder close-up"
        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explaination": "Per visual captions (10-30s), after outdoor shots, the sequence shows Sara indoors with binder (10-20s), then binder close-up (20-30s), followed by heavy machinery action. Audio confirms this progression with classroom preparation speech preceding equipment operation.",

        "Question": "Why is Sara shown reviewing the binder with labeled tabs?",
        "Choice": [
            "A. To prepare for a written exam about safety protocols",
            "B. To demonstrate classroom theory before practical equipment use",
            "C. To compare different heavy equipment brands",
            "D. To document daily construction site activities"
        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explaination": "Audio states 'go through all that... then get on the equipment' (20-30s), synchronized with binder visuals. This shows theoretical preparation precedes hands-on training, requiring integration of speech content and document close-ups.",

        "Choice": [
            "A. She chose this career due to parental pressure",
            "B. Her childhood exposure to equipment sparked her interest",
            "C. She switched careers after emailing Anderson",
            "D. Mountainous terrain inspired her career choice"
        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explaination": "Audio mentions lifelong equipment exposure through her father (10-20s), while visuals show her engaged with training materials and machinery. Both modalities suggest early influences rather than geographical or external factors.",

        "Question": "How does the binder's role differ from the heavy machinery shown?",
        "Choice": [
            "A. Binder displays safety records; machinery demonstrates repairs",
            "B. Binder organizes course materials; machinery enables practical application",
            "C. Binder lists equipment specs; machinery tests speed limits",
            "D. Binder tracks attendance; machinery shows grading criteria"
        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explaination": "Audio-visual synchronization shows binder pages with tabs (visual) during classroom preparation speech (audio: 'go through all that'), contrasting with machinery action shots during speech about hands-on practice. This comparison requires analyzing both content types.",

        "Question": "When Sara mentions 'emailing Anderson', what visual context helps explain this reference?",
        "Choice": [
            "A. Outdoor construction site with excavators",
            "B. Indoor desk with bulletin board notes",
            "C. Program sign with Velocity Inc. branding",
            "D. Binder table of contents page"
        ],
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explaination": "The Velocity Inc. program sign (0-10s) establishes the training provider, while 'emailing Anderson' audio (10-20s) occurs during outdoor scenes showing program participation. This links Anderson to enrollment processes via the branded program.",
