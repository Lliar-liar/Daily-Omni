In this section, a fair-skinned woman with blonde hair is sitting at a light brown desk. She's wearing a gray, long-sleeved shirt. She's looking down at a large, open binder in front of her, turning pages within it. The binder contains numerous white pages divided by labeled tabs. In the background, there is a doorway with a window and a bulletin board covered in papers. Then, the camera focuses on the binder as a hand flips through the pages, revealing a table of contents.
