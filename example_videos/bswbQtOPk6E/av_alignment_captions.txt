"When it comes to Forspoken, we need to talk about Forspoken, and I feel so bad. I don't know if you have heard the news, but the company got bought." -- Ircha is holding a phone in her hands. The scene transitions to gameplay footage showing Frey exploring a misty, mountainous landscape.
"to buy Square Enix, and that is probably and most likely because of the sales of Forspoken, and a direct result of the account" -- Frey runs through a grassy environment towards a distant structure. Then, the scene transitions back to Ircha in front of the bookshelf.
"soul culture, I want to call it that actually. People were hating so much on the game. And maybe I will be one of the few people that will speak up about Forspoken." -- The main character Frey navigates a landscape of brown grass and rocks, then the scene transitions back to Ircha in front of a bookshelf.
