        ],
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explaination": "Per visual captions (10-30s), after outdoor shots, the sequence shows Sara indoors with binder (10-20s), then binder close-up (20-30s), followed by heavy machinery action. Audio confirms this progression with classroom preparation speech preceding equipment operation.",
